NJE38: NJE Subsystem for MVS 3.8 - Version 2.2.1
================================================

March 2021

This is Bob Polmanter's genial NJE subsystem for MVS 3.8. It works perfectly wiht TK4- MVS 3.8 (update 8) and if changes are needed
for the upcomign version of TK4-, then I will make sure those changes are applied to this repo. 

I contributed **nothing** to this software (other than testing it together with Bob), **all the credits go to Bob Polmanter**. 

This software is delivered as is with no guarantee, not from Bob and not from me. 

The included PDF will help you getting it instsalled. Also, watch my video about how to get it running on the moshix mainframe channel on youtube.com

**The current version you should run is NJE38 v2.2.1 !**

Have fun
